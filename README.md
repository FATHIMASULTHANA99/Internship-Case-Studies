# Internship-Case-Studies

### In this repository, I'm collecting all my internship case studies. Each case study explores and demonstrates various aspects of data science, such as hypothesis testing, data visualization, feature engineering, machine learning, and more.

### Think of it like a collection of real-life projects where I tackle different problems using data science techniques. Each project focuses on a different aspect of data analysis and machine learning. It's like a portfolio that showcases my skills and practical experience in solving diverse data-related challenges.

### Whether it's testing hypotheses, creating insightful data visualizations, engineering new features for better predictions, or building machine learning models, each case study serves as an example of how data science can be applied to solve real-world problems. It's a way to document and share my journey and expertise in a straightforward and understandable manner.
